        <p>Hello Proffessor, I am Dhruma Jani, a new student at the Algonquin college this year. I was born on 23<sup>rd</sup> september 2004 in <em>India</em>. I am 18 years old and I am here to learn and develop skills in the creative field. Before transfering to <abbr title=" Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program, I was enrolled in Early Childhood Education program in Algonquin College itself. Being someone who has a keen interest in writing and reading, I have many quotes i believe in but there is this one quote I live by: </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Cause I can't forgive myself, if I am just a servant to my pain."</p>
            <cite>-Colby Brock</cite>
