        <article><h2>About me</h2></article>

        <p> I am Dhruma Jani, a new student at the Algonquin college this year. I was born on 23<sup>rd</sup> september 2004 in <em>India</em>. I am 18 years old and I am here to learn and develop skills in the creative field. Before transfering to <abbr title=" Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program, I was enrolled in Early Childhood Education program in Algonquin College itself. Being someone who has a keen interest in writing and reading, I have many quotes i believe in but there is this one quote I live by: </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Cause I can't forgive myself, if I am just a servant to my pain."</p>
            <cite>-Colby Brock</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>These lines are from a song named <em>Skin</em> by Colby Brock. These lines help me get out of bed everytime I am not feeling good about myself by reminding me that if I don't give my 100% and don't achieve the goals I have set for myself, I will not be able to forgive myself. Apart from being a writer I am also a student, a dancer and a <abbr title="Make up Artist">MUA</abbr>. I believe that creativity is what adds purpose to life no matter what type of creativity it is. That is all about me, I hope I didn't bore you.</p>
